# flutter_sim_country_code

This is a simple plugin that gets the ISO country code from the SIM card to get a more accurate locale, since the system locale is dependent on the phone language.

## Getting Started

1. Install the plugin by adding it to your `pubspec.yaml`.
2. Use `getSimCountryCode()` to get the country code.
